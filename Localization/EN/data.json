               "Patruunantalo was originally built in 1903 as the factory manager’s house. As a villa it resembled a manor and had many offices inside it. It was often remodelled after the current needs of the factory. The main office of Stockfors served in the vicinity of the factory until 1918, when it was moved to Loviisa.£\n\nDuring the war, Patruunantalo served as a place of detention for the factory manager. As the Red Guards decided to execute their plan of killing Lennart Baumgartner and Georg Larsson, Patruunantalo was the place where they managed to capture these two men.£\n\nAs the factories were shut down in 1984 the villa became so badly dilapidated that birches started growing inside the estate. After the property was acquired by a private owner the renovation of Patruunantalo began. The goal was to stay as true as possible to the original villa and its style.£\n\nPatruunantalo worked as a manor hotel for a while, which had a lasting impact on the house’s décor.£\n\nSince 2003, Patruunantalo has been a home to a hotel and a catering service.  Patruunantalo holds modifiable rooms for meetings, celebrations and educational purposes for 5-100 people. The 22 hotel rooms are split between three houses; Patruunantalo, Hunajatalo (which served as a stowage for food during the factory days) and Paloasema, ex fire station." ]},

A significant number of the products are from a private collector Veli Koski. The museum also holds a collection of old Christmas wrap collections and other printed products from Rafael Haarla. Over time, the museum has grown with the owners’ own collections and donations.£\n\nA nearby stable holds a collection of foreign packages and other historical items, such as old phones, toys, cover letters and hunting chariots.

               "A groundwood mill, founded in 1901. A sawmill also operated in Stockfors during 1906-1966, and the company owned forests and hydroelectric power-plants. Stockfors’s mill was Pyhtää’s most vital employer and employed almost a thousand people at its prime. The mechanical wood pulp and sawn timber that the mill produced was mainly sold to South America, United States and Europe.\n\nIndividuals:\n\nOriginally from Norway, engineer Olaf Bülow and consul Ole Nerdrum bought the Stockfors manor in December 1897. Like many other historical manors in Finland, the Stockfors’ manor was an ancestral estate with various owners throughout its history. The land was given to Hans Larsson Björnram in 1570 whose family kept the manor more as a secondary house, and it wasn’t until the manor was owned by the Schatelowitz family that it started to flourish. Gustav Erik Schatelowitz expanded the property by building a new main building. The name and reputation of his son Johan Gustav Schatelowitz brought attention to Stockfors, as he was known as an excellent farmer and was a role model to many other farmers. In 1870, the owner of the Stockfors’ manor changed again as the estate was compulsory auctioned. The new owner Gabriel Terechoff expanded the estate even more by buying nearby properties. After Terechoff passed, his family sold the estate to Bülow and Nerdrum. "]
